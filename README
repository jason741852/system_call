custom system call for QEMU

In user space test code, sysinfo->pid is assigned to be getpid() in line 38
If you wish to test for other pid, simply change this value

Also, the test code is implemented to run BOTH the dummy call in part 1 (line 34) and prinfo syscall.
If this gives you error, just remove the dummy syscall.
